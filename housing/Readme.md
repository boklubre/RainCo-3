# RainCo 3 - Housing

<br>

<br><br>

The circuit board was originally developed for a housing from TRU COMPONENTS with the designation TC-7910744 (EAN: 4064161075587). To my knowledge, this housing is also available from various retailers. However, this housing still needs to be modified (openings for cables, hole for rotary encoder).

That is why I have developed a suitable housing that you can print yourself. In addition to the openings for the cables and the hole for the rotary encoder, it also has ventilation openings.
