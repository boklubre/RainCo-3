# RainCo 3 - Housing

<br>

The circuit board was originally developed for a housing from TRU COMPONENTS with the designation TC-7910744 (EAN: 4064161075587). To my knowledge, this housing is also available from various retailers. However, this housing still needs to be modified (openings for cables, hole for rotary encoder).

That's why I developed a suitable housing that you can print yourself. In addition to the openings for the cables and the hole for the rotary encoder, it also has ventilation openings. 
<br>
Furthermore, the housing is equipped with strain relief for the various cables.

There is a window opening in the cover of the housing. This allows the display to be read and the LED to be monitored. A 2-3 mm thick acrylic/plexiglass pane can be glued into this window opening to better protect the circuit board.
