# RainCo 3 - Valves

## Valves
<br>

We need valves to control different spray circuits. RainCo 3.0 can control up to 6 valves, enabling 6 spray circuits to be implemented.

There are many different suitable valves available from a wide range of manufacturers! Among others, you can also take a look at [MRS-Magnetventile](https://www.mrs-shop.com/magnetventile).
The valves used should be suitable for drinking water and for the pressure supplied by the pump. Furthermore, they should be designed for a DC voltage of 24 volts and be normally closed. The valve coil should draw a maximum of 800mA when open.

I have had very good experiences with valves for osmosis systems. These are inexpensive and can be purchased from Amazon (€14-18) or AliExpress (€5-8), among others. These valves often have a connection for 6mm hoses. They are available from various suppliers/manufacturers/brands, with or without a 6 mm hose connection and for different voltages. So be careful when buying.
It is important to ensure that the valves used are designed for 24 V!
