# RainCo 3.x
<br>

## Introduction
I have been involved in terrarium keeping for decades and have been using sprinkler systems for a long time. Unfortunately, the control methods used to date have not been particularly user-friendly or quick and dynamic to adjust.
<br><br>
Even though there are now very good smart sockets with Wi-Fi or Thread that can be easily integrated into most smart home systems, it is still difficult to control them with split-second precision.
<br><br>
Another problem is that although you can irrigate several terrariums with one irrigation system, they all get the same amount of water. If you want to have different irrigation times, you need separate pumps (and possibly also water tanks) and separate controls for each one.
I have come up with an approach that solves both the control problem and the problem of needing multiple pumps.
<br><br>
I would like to present this approach here and share many of my thoughts with the general public.
<br><br>
I have named the project ‘RainCo’ for ‘Rain Control’. I am now on version 3.x. The other versions are early developments that still had their weaknesses here and there. 
I have been using the current version for about a year and it runs without any problems!
